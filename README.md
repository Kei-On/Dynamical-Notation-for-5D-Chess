# Krakenmagen's Dynamical Notation for 5D-Chess
A dynamical notation for 5D-Chess-with-Multiverse-Time-Travel based on Shad's-5D-chess-algebraic-notation

## Motivation

### [Shad's 5D chess algebraic notation](https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-notation/)

> [5D Chess Notation Standard Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SnsdYIzrGao0ToyGXSaoEd_0tYKxYePO1C-Bp5ziXA/edit#)
> Shadâ€™s notation is meant to work with his engine, which means machine readability was a primary concern when creating the notation. The examples of this notation contain a header which mimics PGN. 
> 
> The symbols that are used in this notation are + for check * for softmate # for checkmate > for a temporal move >> for a branching move, and ~ for a move that rewinds the present. the symbol x is also used to denote a capture of a piece for all types of moves.
In all of the examples listed at the above link, moves are listed by layer ascending for black and descending for white. This is not an explicit rule however.
aside from this, turns are separated with /.

> In my opinion this notation is extremely clean and clear. Sincesince it is so verbose, it avoids a lot of edge cases that may be problems in other notations. This notation is definitely my #2 favorite and a gatekeeper/ benchmark for which to compare other notations. My only complaint is the notation does not bring up the problem of order mattering when branching multiple times in one turn.
